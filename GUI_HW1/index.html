				<h2>Leauge Info:</h2>
				<div class="league_p">
					<p>This fantasy football league started 7 years ago when we were only 14 years
						old. This league is a ten-man Full PPR(point per reception) league with various 
						bonuses that make our league unique from others. Our league is currently in a $50 
						buy-in with $10 anti for the lowest scorer of the previous week. The league commissioner
						is Aiden Chickara, our league treasurer is John Jennings, and our sacko(loser of the league)
						commissioner is Zeke Bettencourt. When you lose the League, you must select three punishments 
						to complete out of the nine punishments recommended by other league members and you must
						complete the punishment you specifically recommended. If punishments are not complete,
						dues/fees are not paid, or cheating is discovered the rest of the league will have a
						vote on the repercussions of the actions of the offender. All League changes must be 
						brought forth to the league and voted upon as well. The vote must be 70-30 in order to pass.
